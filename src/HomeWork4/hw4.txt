1. In general, while the number of folds is decreasing, the running time is decreasing as well.
2. As seen in the results, while the running time is decreasing, the number of instances that 
are being used in the classification phase is decreasing as well, so there is a connection: As 
the number of folds increases, the process of 'learning' is being done more times, (which might 
be the cause for the longer running time), and since it is being done more times, we get more 
and more instances that are part of the learning process. Meaning, the number of instances that 
are used in the classification phase is increasing with the number of folds. Even though there 
are less instances in each fold, as the number of folds is growing, the fact that we run the 
process more times overcomes the fact thst there are less instances in each fold.

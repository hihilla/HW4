1. In general, while the number of folds is decreasing, the running time is decreasing as well, that's because as the number of folds increases,
the process of 'learning' is being done more time which causes longer running time.
2. As seen in the results, while the running time is decreasing, the number of instances that are being used in the classification phase
is decreasing as well, so there is a connection: As the number of folds increases, the process of 'learning' is being done more, 
(which might is the cause for the longer running time), and since it is being done more times, we get more and more instances that are part of the
learning process. Meaning, the number of instances that are used in the classification phase is increasing with the number of folds.
Even though there are less instances in each fold as the number of folds is growing, the fact we run the process more times overcomes the fact there
are less instances in each fold.
